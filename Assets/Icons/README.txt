How to Install:

1. Download the DSFix and extract the files to the "DATA" folder in the game directory e.g. "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition\DATA"

2. Open the DSfix.ini file and change the line enableTextureOverride 0 to enableTextureOverride 1.

- Create Character: There are some minor overlapping issues with the ornaments lines
- Create Character: Ornaments lines don't align perfectly at the center

Limitations:

There are some limitations of what can be changed without causing problems. The most common is that the sometimes the game uses the same texture in various situations. A good example of that is the texture used for the souls counter on the bottom right. It was supposed to have an icon before the numbers, like in Dark Souls III, but I had to removed it because that same texture its also used for the small menu when you press Start, for the arrows count on the bottom left when aiming with the bow and also for the information bars used above the summoning NPCs or players. There are many other textures like these, so I had to find a way that worked well in all the situations where the same texture is used.

Other limitation is with the gestures icons. I left intact the original Dark Souls gesture icons because Dark Souls III doesn't have two of the Dark Souls gestures.
